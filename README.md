# Mazer

Application that solves mazes. That's it.

### Prerequisites

The maze must have one openening at the top and one opening at the bottom. The maze must be black and white. Black is a wall, white is a path.
Everything is done on the pixel level, so walls and paths should only be 1 pixel in width.

### In Progress

Currently all this does is scale an image up and down with the 'W' and 'S' keys. There are a few issues currently that are being worked out.
